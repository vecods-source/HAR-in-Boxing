# HAR-in-Boxing
Human Activity Recognition in Boxing

simply a HAR model which detects human joints and using detection models to classify different models

done:-
  collected a raw database over 300 videos
  annotating using Google mediapioe cnn model
  applied fine tuned LSTM-bi-Dir LSTM and transformer model
  achieving state of art results on the boxing dataset
 

to run the model ("run_video_processor") but you need to specify the location to fit the project location otherwise it will not run

You can check the model action in a video FULL TEST DEMO.mp4
